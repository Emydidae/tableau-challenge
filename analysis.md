# Citi Bike Trends During August from 2020 to 2023

## 2a - Hourly & Yearly Data

Looking at various trip-related statistics sorted by year and type of membership reveals interesting trends.
- Where number of trips & average trip distance follow a general upward trend (2020 being the only exception for trip distance), average trip duration has had a consistent downward trend.
	- This means as trips are getting longer & more people are using the bikes, the amount of time those trips takes is actually decreasing.
- Casual users use the bikes much more later in the day, likely that many non-member users are tourists (as will be seen more in 2b).
	- Casual users also tend to have greater trip distance & duration.
- Regarding the actual shape of the graphs, each seems roughly independent.
	- Spikes in number of trips during rush hours, but trip duration is actually at its lowest around these times.
	- Trip distance varies quite a bit, but does seem to have slight spikes around rush hours.
